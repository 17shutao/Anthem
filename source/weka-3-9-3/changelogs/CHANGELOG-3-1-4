- Reworked cost sensitive classification and evaluation. Cost matrices are
  now handled as a class CostMatrix. Code related to cost matrices has been
  moved from Instances into CostMatrix. Evaluation has been updated to use
  CostMatrix (and the old cost file format is still read). Created a meta
  classifier for performing cost-sensitve classification using either
  training instance reweighting or minimum expected cost prediction. Made a
  simple editor for cost matrices and adjusted other GUI files to support
  this.

- Also made some small GUI layout changes.
